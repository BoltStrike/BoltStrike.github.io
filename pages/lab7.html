            <p>
                Lab 7 implements a Kalman Filter in order to estimate where the car is at in 
                between the slower TOF readings, replacing the linear extrapolation from Lab 5.
            </p>

            <h4><Strong>The Kalman Filter</Strong></h4>

            <p>
                A Kalman filter consists of two primary steps, being a prediction step and then an 
                update step. The prediction step uses the state space model to estimate what value the 
                TOF would be at, while the update step uses a new TOF reading to update the state space model.
                The following pseudocode from Lecture 13 shows this split.
            </p>
            <div class = "centered">

            </div>
            <p>
                The state space for the car is a 2D vector of position and velocity, represented 
                by mu in the above image. The next position and velocity are then predicted using the matrices
                A and B.
            </p>
            <h4><Strong>Drag and Momentum</Strong></h4>
            <p>
                The matrics A and B are shown in the below image from lecture 13, multiplied by
                [X, Xdot] and u respectively:
            </p>
            <div class = "centered">
                <img src="/images/lab7/model.png" alt="State space model" class="responsive-img">
            </div>
            <p>
                In order to create A and B, the drag and momentum of the system need to be solved 
                for. This is done by having the car reach a steady speed and finding the velocity for 
                a given step size u. I chose to run my car at a analog value of 125, which is 75% of the 
                max value 166 I can run (accounting for scaling the wheels to go straight). I ran the car 
                straight at the wall and stopped once it was in a meter as to not crash. This gave the following 
                TOF graph and motor control:

                    <div class = "column">

                    Steady Speed TOF and motor readings

            </div>
            <p>
                There is a bit of noise at the beginning due to other objects near the wall being seen,
                but it ends up reaching full speed and approaching the wall at a constant velocity before 
                stopping. When trying to calculate velocity, I took the difference between each TOF measurement 
                and divided this by the difference in timestamps. However, this resulted in incredibly noisy 
                velocity data, due to the dt varying a lot. Instead to get velocity, I fit a exponential decay 
                model to the TOF data.
            </p>
            <div class = "centered">
                <img src="/images/lab7/exp.png" alt="Exponential Decay" class="responsive-img">
            </div>
            <p>
                While not a perfect fit, it approximates the steady state speed decently. The velocity for this 
                is below:
            </p>
            <div class = "centered">
                <img src="/images/lab7/expvel.png" alt="Exponential Decay Velocity" class="responsive-img">
            </div>
            <p>
                This graph displays the max velocity to be at -2.89 m/s. However, this method gave no way 
                to find 90% of the rise time to the max speed, and I also felt it could still fit better.
                I instead wrote code to fit a series of line segments to the TOF readings, with one line segment 
                per 20 data points. This produced the following fit:
            </p>
            <div class = "centered">
                <img src="/images/lab7/lines.png" alt="Linear fit" class="responsive-img">
            </div>
            <p>
                The velocities from each of these line segments are displayed below:
            </p>
            <div class = "centered">
                <img src="/images/lab7/linevels.png" alt="Linear fit" class="responsive-img">
            </div>
            <p>
                Every 20 data points helped eliminate a lot of the noise while still having enough 
                granularity to determine the top speed. With this, the top speed was found to be -3.16 m/s.
                90% of the this top speed is -2.844 m/s, which takes a rise time of 1639 milliseconds. Note 
                that speeds were negative due to the distance to the wall shrinking.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the steady state velocity, the drag can be calculated. This is the step response u over the 
                velocity. I treat 125 analog write as a step response of 1, so the drag is 1/3.16, or 0.3163. The 
                equation for momentum is shown below:
            </p>
            <div class = "centered">
                <img src="/images/lab7/mom.png" alt="Momentum" >
            </div>
            <p>
                This plugs in to be -0.3163*1.604/ln(0.1), or 0.2093. Both the Drag and momentum 
                are later scaled down by 1000 to match the TOF mm input, giving d = 0.0003163 and 
                m = 0.0002093. These can then be plugged in to solve for the A and B matrices.

            <p>
                The python code for initializing these arrays is shown below:
            </p>

            <code>
                <pre>
                    d = .3163/1000
                    m = .2093/1000
                    
                    A = np.array([[0,1],[0,-d/m]])
                    B = np.array([[0],[1/m]])
                               
                    dt = []
                    summing = 0
                    for i in range(len(testtof)-1):
                        dt =  (testtof[i+1] - testtof[i])/1000
                        summing = summing+dt
                    Delt_T = summing/len(testtof)
                    
                    Ad = np.eye(2) + Delt_T*A
                    Bd = Delt_T*B
                    C = np.array([[1,0]])

            <p>
                This initializes the A, B, and C matrices. Additionally, it calculates the 
                average timestep between each TOF reading and uses that to discretize A and B. This is 
                done following the discretization method from lecture. I used a PID run using the Lab5 code 
                for my TOF data, which had an average Delt_T of 8 milliseconds. Ad and Bd are below:
            </p>
            <div class = "centered">
                <img src="/images/lab7/ABD.png" alt="Momentum" >
            </div>
            <p>
                My C matrix ended up being [[1,0]] as the distance from the wall is positive. I also 
                initalized my state space matrix as <code>x = np.array([[tof_arr1[0]], [0]])</code>,
                starting at the first TOF reading for position and 0 for velocity as the car is 
                presumably not moving.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, process and sensor noise covariance matrices needed to be created. The 
                process noise, sig_u, specifies how much the Kalman filter states should be trusted,
                while the sensor noise, sig_z, indicates how much the TOF sensor should be trusted.
                Sigma_z is composed of the value Sigma_3 squared. I chose this to be a value of 20 mm to 
                start, as the TOF sensor datasheet specifies it has precision of +/- 20 mm in the dark.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sigma_u is broken into two pieces, Sigma_1 and Sigma_2. Sigma_1 is how much the position 
                state of our state model is mistrusted, and Sigma_2 is how much the velocity is not trusted.
                Sigma_1 is initalized to 15mm of mistrust, scaled by the delta_T, and Sigma_2 is 15 mm/s. These
                values will likely have to change as the Kalman filter's performance is observed.
            </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                    sigma_3 = 0.02 #plus or minus 20 mm data
                    sigma_1 = np.sqrt(0.015**2*1/Delt_T)
                    sigma_2 = np.sqrt(0.015**2*1/Delt_T)

                    sig_u=np.array([[sigma_1**2,0],[0,sigma_2**2]]) #We assume uncorrelated noise, and therefore a diagonal matrix works.
                    sig_z=np.array([[sigma_3**2]])
                </pre>
            </code>
            <p>
                This results in the following matrices:
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                Additionally, an initial sigma array for the KF is initialized with values of 20mm and 5mm/s,
                as there should be less uncertainty in velocity due to it starting from stop.

            <h4><Strong>Kalman Filter in Python</Strong></h4>
            <p>
                In order to simulate the Kalman filter in Python, I used a PID run using the lab 5 code. 
                The TOF readings and PWM commands to the motor are below:

            <p>
                I then implemented the Kalman filter, mostly copying the code from the write up.
            </p>

            <p>
                I added code to split the prediction and update step based on whether a new value was read.
                Next, I iterated through my data to call this Kalman Filter:

                    while(i <= tofrange):

                        KF_time.append(float(i))

                        KF_dist.append(x[0][0])

            <p>
                I divided each motor input by 125 to make sure the step response was scaled properly,
                as I determined earlier 125 to be my step response of 1. The following shows my first result 
                with this filter.

                This run had the Kalman filter match the curve well when on the update steps, but ultimately 
                performed poorly when making predictions. What I discovered was that this was the result of the 
                PID run being on carpet, while the calibrations I did for drag and momentum were on tile. This 
                demonstates that by overestimating the momentum, the model is unable to overcome this larger momentum 
                and constantly assumes the car will go further than it does. Taking a tile PID run gets this filter

                While better, there is still some jagged edges. Zooming in to the curve helps show why

            <p>
                When rapidly changing directions, the filter is slow to adjust. This ended up being due 
                to the model being trusted too little, so the model's changing velocity and position would be ignored. By reducing Sigma_1 to 0.0045 instead of 0.02 and 
                Sigma_2 to 0.01 instead of 0.02, I made the kalman filter much more responsive and smooth.

            <p>
                As an interesting comparison, when I made both Sigma_1 and Sigma_2 significantly smaller (0.0001), the model started to 
                behave almost the same as if it was to extrapolate values, with the Kalman Filter predicting along 
                a line between the last two points.

            <p>
                I also messed around with various other parameters to see how they impact the filter.
                The starting mu and sigma only really impacted how close the filter was to the 
                initial few readings, with bad starting mu and sigmas still eventually approximating the line.
                Raising the sensor noise uncertainty by increasing Sigma 3 was interesting, as the filter would 
                still follow the general shape of the curve, but would be offset on the y axis.
            </p>

                After all of this, I ended up getting the following graph, which functioned very well, with only a small spike when 
                it abruptly stopped.

            <p>
                To implement the filter on the robot, I leveraged the Basic Linear Algebra 
                library from Arduino, which simplifies matrix operations. I then initialized 
                the necessary matrices in my car object for use.

                I then implemented the kalman filter function itself using these matrices.

                Initially, I had hardcoded the values for Ad and Bd into the program, using the 
                timestep of 8 milliseconds. However, I found that this timestep was too variable, specifically
                with the addition of all the kalman filter math making it take longer, resulting in the 
                filter consistently mispredicting. By dynamically calculating Ad and Bd for each dt, I 
                was able to resolve this issue. I then replaced the extrapolation code I had prevously with 
                a call to this filter, passing in false to indicate predicting. A similar call is made when a 
                new TOF reading is made, but with true passed instead.

            <code>
                <pre>
                    if(mycar.kalstart) {
                        mycar.fronttof = kalman(-((float)mycar.motor_hist[mycar.e_pos-1])/125.0, mycar.last_frontof,false);
                
                        if(tof_iter1 < DATA_LENGTH && collecting) {
                            tof[tof_iter1][0] = mycar.fronttof;
                            tofstamps[tof_iter1] = millis();
                            tof_iter1 ++;
                        }

                I ended up doing a bit more tuning to get the sigma values to work for the physical car,
                dropping sigma_3 to be 10mm, meaning that the TOF sensor seemed to be more reliable than the 
                datasheet suggested. I then ran the following PID control with the Kalman Filter:
            </p>
            <div class="centered">
                <video width="640" height="480" controls>

                </video> 
            </div>
            <p>
                This was successful, peforming very similarly to the interpolated PID control. The following image 
                displays the TOF readings, including the Kalman Filter readings.

            <p>
                In order to better show the effect of the Kalman filter, a zoomed in image of the curve when the 
                car reverses is shown, with the blue dots being the raw TOF readings and the orange being the 
                Kalman Filter predictions.
            </p>

                While not perfect, with the filter sometimes overshooting or undershooting, this shows that 
                the Kalman filter was able to adapt to the sudden change in direction very well, continuing to 
                give useful predictions. This is better than the extrapolation method, which tended to significantly 
                overshoot when reversing directions. The next steps are to increase the speed of the filter to 
                allow for even more accurate data to let the car run faster, and possibly to tune a bit more.

                I worked in the lab section on this code with Giorgi Berndt and Jorge Corpa Chunga, discussing the general approach but not 
                specific code. I referred to Mikayla Lahr's lab 7 website from last year to check that my values were within a reasonable range 
                and for structuring this page.
