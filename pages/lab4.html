            <p>
                The goal of Lab 4 was to solder our motor drivers to the Artemis and connect them to the car, allowing for the car
                to be controlled by the Artemis with open loop control.
            </p>
            <h3><Strong>Prelab:</Strong></h3>
            <h4><Strong>Circuit diagram:</Strong></h4>
            <p>
                The circuit I decided to use for wiring the motors is as diagrammed below:
            </p>
            <div class = "centered">

            </div>
            <p>
                In order to be able to drive the motors, the GPIO pins had to be PWM capable, which meant pins 8 and 10 couldn't be used.
                Additionally, they had to be analog pins. I ultimately used pins A3, A14, A15, and A16 as they were all located on the opposite side of
                the Artemis programming port, meaning the programming port could be easily accessible at the edge of the car while the pins would be closer to the 
                motors. The full circuit with IMU and TOF sensors is below:

            <h4><Strong>Battery:</Strong></h4>
            <p>
                The Artemis and the motors are run off of separate batteries, with the Artemis being run off of a 650 mAh battery and the motors
                running from a 850 mAh battery. This has the advantage of avoiding transients, or sudden changes in voltage or current. For example, 
                if everything was connected to one battery and the motors suddenly drew a lot of current, the battery voltage could temporarily drop outside 
                of the Artemis's operational voltage range, shutting it down. Separating the batteries avoids these types of events.
            </p>

            <h3><Strong>Lab:</Strong></h3>
            <h4><Strong>Verification of Motor Drivers</Strong></h4>
            <p>
                The first step was to solder the motor driver connections to the Artemis and test that it could output appropriate PWM signals.
                I experimented with a few ways to connect the outputs in parallel, but found the easiest was to through hole solder a wire for each 
                connection, and then solder those wires together. To test the motor driver, I connected an oscilloscope to the output signal of the 
                motor driver and grounded it. I powered the driver from an external power supply. I chose 3.7 volts as that is the voltage that the 
                850 mAh battery will provide. A video showing the setup and the resulting 50 percent duty cycle pwm waves for both drivers is shown below:

            <h4><Strong>Wiring to Car</Strong></h4>
            <p>
                Next, both motor controllers were wired into the car. This involved removing the preexisting circuit board and soldering those 
                motor connections to the motor driver output. To test these motors, I kept the drivers attached to the external power supply and 
                made the following code in the loop funtion to drive them forwards for 5 seconds, and backwards for 5 seconds:
            </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                    analogWrite(3, 150);
                    analogWrite(16, 150);
                    analogWrite(14, 0);
                    analogWrite(15, 0);
                    delay(5000); 
                    analogWrite(14, 150);
                    analogWrite(15, 150);
                    analogWrite(3, 0);
                    analogWrite(16, 0);
                    delay(5000); 
                </pre>
            </code>

            <p>
                The following video demonstrates this code running on the car:

            <p>
                Next, I tested running everything fully from battery. This involved soldering the battery cables to the motor driver. 
                Then, the above code was run with only these batteries as power.
            </p>

            <p>
                I then affixed each component into the car. Each component is held in place by foam tape currently. I chose to place the motor drivers
                by the cable for the 850 mAh battery and away from the Artemis and IMU to avoid EMF interference. I had the QWIIC multiport in 
                the center of the car so each component could be easily reached, and put the TOF sensors on the outside, ensuring they were angled as 
                to not just detect the ground.

            <h4><Strong>PWM Limits</Strong></h4>
            <p>
                I then tested what PWM values the motors would actually operate under, by changing the values provided in AnalogWrite out of 255. Firstly, testing the car going forward with both motors, 
                I found that an analog write value of 50 was sufficient to make the car go forward under load. Without load, this 
                only drives one motor, implying that with load one motor was spinning the other wheels enough to overcome static friction. An analog write of 60, 
                or 23.5% duty cycle would drive both forward without load. For going backwards, this went up to 70.
            </p>
            <p>
                To have the car spin on axis, I found that a write of 140 was necessary to get both wheels running, although it took a bit for the left wheels to start moving. 150 
                ensured that the car would immediately turn on the spot. The following video shows an on axis turn with write values of 140.
            </p>

            <h4><Strong>Calibrating motors</Strong></h4>
            <p>
                I found that my right wheels spun faster than my left wheels, and even rotating them by hand, I could feel that
                the left wheels had more resistance. Running both wheels at 100 caused the car to veer left.
            </p>

            <div class="centered">
                <video width="640" height="480" controls>

            </div>
            <p>
                To fix this, I used a multiplication factor to increase the pwm written to the left wheels. I found at low speeds a value of
                1.52 worked the best, although at higher speeds a value of 1.4 was sufficient. The following shows the car going in a straight line.
            </p>

            <div class="centered">

            </div>

            <p>
                I also found that setting both motors to 0 to stop it would result in the car pivoting left. I counteracted this in code by running the right motors
                in reverse for a short period when stopping.
            </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                    //stopping
                    analogWrite(sig2, 50);
                    analogWrite(sig4, 0);
                    analogWrite(sig1, 0);
                    analogWrite(sig3, 0);
                    delay(50);
                    val = 0;
                    analogWrite(sig2, 0);
                    analogWrite(sig4, 0);
                    analogWrite(sig1, 0);
                    analogWrite(sig3, 0);
                </pre>

            <h4><Strong>Open Loop Control</Strong></h4>
            <p>
                To demonstrate open loop control, I programmed the car to drive in approximately a square, using the following code:
            </p>

            <code>
                <pre>
                    //deadband
                    analogWrite(sig1, 70);
                    analogWrite(sig4, 70*adjust);
                    analogWrite(sig2, 0);
                    analogWrite(sig3, 0);
                    delay(50); 
                    //normal speed
                    analogWrite(sig1, 40);
                    analogWrite(sig4, 40*adjust);
                    analogWrite(sig2, 0);
                    analogWrite(sig3, 0);
                  
                    delay(2000);
                    //turn
                    analogWrite(sig1, 140);
                    analogWrite(sig3, 140*adjust);
                    analogWrite(sig2, 0);
                    analogWrite(sig4, 0);
                  
                    delay(250);
                </pre>
            </code>
            <p>
                This would loop to go straight slowly, then turn. A video of this behavior is below:

            <h3><Strong>5000 Tasks:</Strong></h3>
            <p>
                I found the frequency of analogWrite by writing 50% pwm to pin A2 and measuring it with an oscilloscope.
            </p>
            <div class = "centered">
                <img src="/images/lab4/freq.png" alt="Oscilloscope frequency" class="responsive-img">
            </div>
            <p>
                This found the frequency to be about 182 Hertz. This is a relatively low frequency for PWM, but appears to be sufficient for these 
                motors as it gets them running at a relatively consistent speed. The concern of low frequency PWM is that the motors would be less smooth, 
                as the motor acts as a lowpass filter and ideally only recieves a dc average voltage, but with low frequencies may also be influenced by the AC component. Using timers to
                produce a faster PWM frequency could hypothetically make the motors run smoother and less noisely.
            </p>

            <p>
                To test the lower limits of the PWM once static friction had initially been overcome, I set the motors to run at the minimum values I found above and then 
                dropped them until the wheels no longer moved. This can be seen in the start of the open loop code above. I found that I could keep moving 
                straight forward dropping to an analog value of 40, or a duty cycle of 15%. For spinning on axis, I could drop from 140 to 110 analog and keep spinning, 
                or a duty cycle of 43%. Below is a video of the spinning at a lower PWM:
            </p>

            <p>
                I initially did this testing by running the starting value for 50 ms. I found through experimentation it needed to be ran for at least 20ms,
                as otherwise the wheels would take longer to spin up, shown below with 15 ms:
