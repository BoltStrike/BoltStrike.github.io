            <p>
                The goal of Lab 5 was to implement a closed loop control system. For this lab, I decided to implement 
                a PID controller, with the goal of havig the car approach and stop one foot from an object.
            </p>
            <h3><Strong>Prelab:</Strong></h3>
            <h4><Strong>Bluetooth:</Strong></h4>
            <p>
                Before starting on PID, I implemented bluetooth commands for both prompting the car to drive and recording/transmitting 
                data. The code for starting the car driving and collecting data is below:
            </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                    case DRIVE:
                    {
                      mycar.driving = 1;
                      mycar.start_time = millis();
                      mycar.e_pos = 0;
                      break;
                    }
                </pre>
            </code>
            <p>
                This case sets a flag to indicate the car should drive and colllect data in the main loop function, and records 
                a start time. This start time is compared against the <code>millis()</code> command to see if 5 seconds have elapsed. 
                If so, the car stops driving and recording data. This time is later extended to 20 seconds once the PID control is more
                tuned. It also sets an index for iterating and recording data back to 0. Data can be sent back with the <code>GET_PID</code>
                command below:
            </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                    case GET_PID:
                    {
                    for (int i = 0; i < mycar.e_pos; i++) {
                            tx_estring_value.clear();
                            tx_estring_value.append("Prop:");
                            tx_estring_value.append(mycar.e_hist[i]);
                            tx_estring_value.append("Motor:");
                            tx_estring_value.append(mycar.motor_hist[i]);
                            tx_estring_value.append("Time:");
                            tx_estring_value.append(mycar.t_hist[i]);
                            tx_characteristic_string.writeValue(tx_estring_value.c_str());
                    }
                    break;
                    }
                </pre>
            </code>
            <p>
                This writes proportional error, motor control, and timestamps to the Python script over bluetooth. This is prompted with 
                <code>ble.send_command(CMD.GET_PID, "")</code>, where a notification handler parses the values into an array to graph, as below:
            </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                    prop = []
                    time = []
                    motor = []
                    def pid_data_handler(uuid, bytearr):
                        try:
                            tofdata = ble.bytearray_to_string(bytearr)
                            arr = tofdata.split("Prop:")[1] #Split messages
                            prop1, arr = arr.split("Motor:")
                            motor1, time1 = arr.split("Time:")
                            prop.append(int(prop1))
                            motor.append(int(motor1))
                            time.append(int(time1))
                        except Exception as e:
                            print(e)


                    ble.start_notify(ble.uuid['RX_STRING'], pid_data_handler)
                </pre>
            </code>
            <p>
                The TOF data is sent separately with its own timestamps using a command implemented in lab 3, with its own notification handler. I additionally added a <code>SET_KPID</code>
                command to tune KP, KI, and KD without reprogramming, seen below:
            </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                    case SET_KPID:
                    {
                        float P, I, D;
            
                        success = robot_cmd.get_next_value(P);
                        if (!success)
                          return;
            
                        success = robot_cmd.get_next_value(I);
                        if (!success)
                          return;
            
                        success = robot_cmd.get_next_value(D);
                        if (!success)
                            return;
                        mycar.SKP = P;
                        mycar.SKI = I;
                        mycar.SKD = D;
                        break;

            <p>
                To implement my PID control, I started by making a car class which would contain all variables for the car.
                This includes variables for last tof readings, arrays for errors, motor history, and timestamps to send over bluetooth, 
                and variables pertaining to PID control. Later, values for TOF extrapolation are also stored here.

            <p>
                Since I am a 5000 level student, I had to decide between PI and PID control. I chose PID as the derivative term allows for 
                more control over how much the car overshoots and makes the controller more precise overall. My methodology was to start 
                by tuning the proportional control, keeping KI and KD at 0 until I liked it. I wrote my PID control by referring to the 
                provided PID-FastRobots.ipynb and class notes, with below showing just the P control.
            </p>

            <code>
                <pre>
                    float calc_pid(int dist, int setpoint, float KP = mycar.SKP, float KI = mycar.SKI, float KD = mycar.SKD, float alpha = 0.9) {

                        //proportional terms
                        int e = dist-setpoint;

                        mycar.e_pos ++;
                      
                        if (mycar.e_pos >= PID_LENGTH) { 
                          mycar.e_hist[0] = mycar.e_hist[PID_LENGTH-2];

                          mycar.motor_hist[1] = mycar.motor_hist[PID_LENGTH-1];
                          for(int i = 2; i < PID_LENGTH; i++) {
                            mycar.e_hist[i] = 0;
                          }
                          mycar.e_pos = 2;
                        }

                        return KP*e; //P sum

            </code>
            <p>
                The P term is the difference between a setpoint and the TOF reading. The setpoint used was 304 millimeters, or one foot.
                I wanted the output to be roughly between -166 and 166, as these were the max analog pwm values for my car with scaling considered.
                I then approximated that I would want the car to go max speed until about 2000 millimeters from target and then slow down. Taking 166/2000,
                I got a value of 0.083, which is what I started my KP at. I found that this had the car approach the wall too fast and run into it, so I tuned 
                it down, finding 0.055 to be a good balance of approach speed while not overshooting as far. I additionally had to implement clamping on the output 
                value, making it not allowed to go above 166 or below -166, and also keeping it outside of my deadband of 50 to -50. 
                Additionally, I had to change the TOF sensors to be in long range mode so it could see the wall starting 2+ meters away,
                and I set the timing budget for these sensors to be 33 milliseconds, which is as fast as possible for the long mode. This 
                allows for more frequent TOF readings and therefore better control.
                The following video demonstrates this proportional only control.

                This KP value of 0.055 had the car overshoot the target, and then backup and oscillate around it until stopping. Lower KP values 
                would minimize this overshoot, but made the approach much slower, so I stuck with this value. In order to stop the car, I took 
                an average of the last 15 error readings. If this mean was below 3 millimeters, the car would stop as it was oscillating roughly on
                the target spot. I additionally implemented code from lab 4 that overcomes static friction for lowspeed commands, with PWMs of under 70 
                being run at 70 for 25 milliseconds before dropping to the slower value. The recorded graphs for this run are below:

                These graphs show how the car oscillated around the target before eventually stopping, with the motor control

            <p>
                Next I implemented derivative control. This leveraged the error data I was already collecting, shown in the following code
            </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                    ...
                    if (mycar.e_pos > 1) {

                        float d = (mycar.e_hist[mycar.e_pos-1] - mycar.e_hist[mycar.e_pos-2]) / (float(mycar.dt)/1000);
                        mycar.dF = d*alpha + (1-alpha)* mycar.dF;
                      }
                      else {
                        mycar.dF = 0;
                      }
                      return KP*e + KD*mycar.dF;
                </pre>
            </code>
            <p>
                The derivative's purpose is to dampen the control, comparing change in error over time. I experimented with 
                different KD values to try to reduce overshoot and total oscillations. I found a KD of 0.016 seemed to work best, which 
                makes sense as the derivative term shouldn't overpower the proportional. Additionally, I used a lowpass filter on this 
                derivative with an alpha of 0.9 to help reduce sensor noise. For this assignment, since the setpoint is always the same,
                I didn't address derivative kick yet.
                With PD control, I got the following performance:
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                This overshot the target point much less and had overall smaller oscillations. The graphs for this control are as follows:

            <p>
                Interestingly, the derivative control introduced oscillations into the actual PWM sent to the motor. Smaller KD's minimize
                these oscillations, but I found KD= 0.016 to be the best for approaching and stopping on the spot.
            </p>
            <p>
                I finally added the integral control. This accumulates overtime to help counteract steady state error. An example of 
                where this type of control is useful is on a hill or rough terrain, where the PD control term isn't high enough to move the vehicle.
                The code for this is below:
            </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                    ...
                    mycar.I += e * float(mycar.dt)/1000; // integral term
                    return KP*e + KD*mycar.dF + KI*mycar.I; //PID sum
                </pre>
            </code>
            <p>
                This integral term isn't as impactful when running the car on smooth tiles, so for calibrating, I started with a high KI and 
                decreased it until the car was close to the PD performance, while still keeping it high enough to reduce the oscillations caused 
                by error in the sensor readings. I ended up with a KI of 0.003. The performance of the PID control is below:
            </p>

                This causes the car to stop on the target with minimal oscillations, overall giving the best performance. The graphs for this run

                This error and TOF show that the car overshot by even less than the PD control and roughly stopped on the spot. This 
                is also reflected by the motor control not going in reverse for a significant period of time. I calculated the rough 
                maximum speed that was being acheived repeatablly off of the TOF graph, seeing it goes about 2000 millimeters in 1.75 seconds,
                or 1.14 m/s or 3.28 ft/s. Granted, the motor controller shows that the car isn't consistently driven at the max PWM of 166, so 
                starting further away the car should go even faster.

            <h3><Strong>Extrapolation</Strong></h3>
            <p>
                Using timestamps from my error graph versus my TOF graph in python, I observed that my TOF data was collected every 
                30-40 ms, whereas the PID loop ran every 12 ms consitently. I coded the TOF readings to occur at the beginning of the PID
                loop while being non blocking, so this meant the PID loop ran roughly 3 times as fast as the TOF readings, or each TOF 
                reading would be used 3 times for PID calculations. This also impacts the D term, as it would be 0 whenever a new TOF reading
                didn't come in. The solution to this was to extrapolate TOF readings inbetween the actual sensor return. I did this 
                by taking the time and value of the last two TOF readings. By subtracting the current TOF reading from the last one and dividing 
                by the difference in times, I got a slope of the mm/ms that the TOF was changing by. By multiplying this by the time since the 
                last TOF reading and adding that to the TOF value, I approximated what the actual value would be. This is done in the following
                TOF code:
            </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                    //collect TOF data
                    
                    if (tof1.checkForDataReady()) {
                        //Serial.println("here");
                        int new_time = millis();
                        int dist = tof1.getDistance();
                        if(mycar.fronttof != -5160) {
                        float diff_time = new_time - mycar.last_tof;
                        float diff_meas = dist - mycar.last_frontof;
                        mycar.slope = diff_meas/diff_time;
                        }
                    
                        mycar.last_tof = new_time;
                        mycar.fronttof = dist; //Get the result of the measurement from the sensor
                        mycar.last_frontof = dist;
                    
                        tof1.clearInterrupt();
                        tof1.stopRanging();
                        tof1.startRanging();
                        if(tof_iter1 < DATA_LENGTH && collecting) {
                        tof[tof_iter1][0] = mycar.fronttof;
                        tofstamps[tof_iter1] = millis();
                        tof_iter1 ++;
                        }
                    }
                    else { //extrapolate tof
                        if(mycar.slope != -5160) { //if valid slope
                        float dif_time = millis() - mycar.last_tof; //find time diff
                        mycar.fronttof = mycar.last_frontof + dif_time*mycar.slope; //Extrapolate TOF reading
                        if(tof_iter1 < DATA_LENGTH && collecting) { //record for bluetooth
                            tof[tof_iter1][0] = mycar.fronttof;
                            tofstamps[tof_iter1] = millis();
                            tof_iter1 ++;
                        }
                        }
                    }
                </pre>
            </code>

            <p>
                Notably, two TOF readings are needed for this to work, so I used a placeholder value of -5160 to make sure 
                that this condition was met. Running the PID with this code ended up looking very similar to the above runs. However,
                I validated that the change actually did function by printing the extrapolated values from my TOF graph, seen below.
            </p>
            <div class = "centered">
                <img src="/images/lab5/TOFextrap.png" alt="TOF Extrapolation" class="responsive-img">
            </div>
            <p>
                Additionally, I checked how often the TOF was being updated now, with the timestamps shown below.
            </p>
            <div class = "centered">

                This shows the TOF being calculated and changed at the same rate as the PID loop, about every 12 ms. While the general
                behavior with this was the same, I found the performance of the car to be more consistent in stopping on the spot, as 
                sometimes the car could get a TOF value late and overshoot more without this extrapolation.

            <h3><Strong>5000 Tasks:</Strong></h3>
            <h4><Strong>Integrator Windup:</Strong></h4>
            <p>
                When using an integrator term for PID, windup becomes an issue. This is when the integrator grows too large and is unable 
                to shrink fast enough, resulting in the car travelling well past the target point. An example where this could occur is transitioning
                from a surface the car moves slow on to one it moves fast on. To demonstrate this issue, I held the car in my hand to let this 
                term build up, and then released it in the following video.
            </p>
            <div class="centered"></div>
            <video width="640" height="480" controls>

                </video> 
            </div>
            <p>
                By the time the car is let go, the integral term has built up so high that the car will always run at max speed, running 
                directly into the wall without stopping. To fix this, the integral term needs to be clamped, which I do in the following code:
            </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                    mycar.I += e * float(mycar.dt)/1000; // integral term
                    if(mycar.I > 1000) {
                      mycar.I = 1000;
                    }
                    else if (mycar.I < -1000){
                      mycar.I = -1000;
                    }
                </pre>
            </code>
            <p>
                I decided to clamp it to 1000 by experimenting with what the max value that still allowed the car to stop on target was. Too small 
                of a value will prevent the integral term from functioning, and too large will not prevent the windup. 1000 seemed to work well for this 
                purpose, shown in the video below.
            </p>
            <div class="centered"></div>
            <video width="640" height="480" controls>

                </video> 
            </div>
            <p>
                With the same setup of letting the integrator term increase, this clamp prevents it from getting too high, having the car still stop on target. 
                This clamp value could be increased if the integrator term was not performant enough for particular conditions, but as stated before, it has to
                be balanced to prevent too much windup.

                I worked in the lab section on this code with Giorgi Berndt and Jorge Corpa Chunga, discussing the general approach but not 
                specific code. When working on tuning the PID values,I also collaborated with Aidan McNay. 
                For determining how to demonstrate and solve the integrator windup, Giorgi and I collaborated 
                to come up with the idea of holding it in place to build up the error.
                I additionally referred to the Lecture slides for PID and the PID-FastRobots.ipynb code as a basis for 
                creating my PID funciton.
