            <p>
                Lab 8 involved implementing a stunt on the RC car, being either a flip or a drift. I chose to implement a drift as it 
                seemed less likely to damage the car than a flip.
            </p>

            <h3><Strong>Lab:</Strong></h3>
            <h4><Strong>The Drift</Strong></h4>
            <p>
                In order to initiate a drift, I created a new bluetooth command. This command, SKRT, set a flag that would prompt the car to start drifting.
                Additionally, it also records a time used to timeout the system. The code for this is below:
            </p>
            <div class = "centered">
                <img src="/images/lab8/BT.png" alt="Bluetooth command" class="responsive-img">
            </div>
            <p>
                I split the drift task into 3 main components. The first was driving to 3 feet, or 904 mm, of a wall, where the drift would be initiated. The second part 
                is completing a 180 degree turn or drift. Once this has been completed, the third step is to drive away in a straight line. 
                The two straight line components can be done with just open loop control, driving as fast as possible towards the wall and away from it. However,
                I decided to initially implement this using PID control as I found that just driving to the wall at full speed would cause the car 
                to slide into the wall. PID control would allow for the car to approach the wall fast but slow down a bit before doing the drift, making it slide less far. 
                I used a higher P value of 0.12 as I still wanted the car to be going relatively fast even when it was close to the target. Additionally, using PID would 
                prevent collisions during driving away. The code for the first state of driving straight to the wall is below:
            </p>
            <div class = "centered">
                <img src="/images/lab8/state0.png" alt="First state" class="responsive-img">
            </div>
            <p>
                This occurs in the main loop of the program. Once the drift command is recieved over bluetooth, the distance target is 
                set to 3 feet (904 mm) and <code>mycar.driving</code> would be set to make the car drive forward with PID control. Once the front 
                TOF sensor is within 3 feet, the turn is initiated by setting the orientation target to the current yaw plus 180 degrees. It then 
                indicated that the next state should be progressed to. One bug I encountered 
                is that by using PID control for both the initial approach and the orientation, the integral term was built up during the drive approach, and thus was too 
                high for the orientation step. This made the car overshoot the setpoint significantly, and was fixed by setting the integral back to 0 on the state shift.
                The next state was simpler, shown below:
            </p>
            <div class = "centered">
                <img src="/images/lab8/state1.png" alt="second state" class="responsive-img">
            </div>
            <p>
                In order to have the orientation as close to a 180 degree turn as possible while still finishing fast, I created 
                a way to determine when the majority of the oscillations of the PID contol were done. I accomplished this by taking the average of 
                the last 10 error measurements from the PID. If on average these were within 2 degrees accuracy, the car would go to the next state.
                I chose 2 degrees and 10 measurements through experimentation. A smaller value than 2 degrees would be more accurate in acheiving the 180 degrees turn, but 
                take longer to oscillate to. Conversly, a larger average can be acheived earlier, but trades off accuracy. I found this still sometimes 
                would go to the next state early, so I made it so each of the last 10 measurements had to be under 10 degrees off as well. Once this condition was 
                met, the final state below occurs:
            </p>
            <div class = "centered">
                <img src="/images/lab8/state2.png" alt="third state" class="responsive-img">
            </div>
            <p>
                The final state would just drive away from the wall, timing out after 3 seconds.
                Additionally, the PID helps keep it from running into any other objects.
            </p>

            <h4><Strong>The Results</Strong></h4>
            <p>
                My general approach to each trial was to record the error input to the PID loop for each stage, the TOF sensor readings (with Kalman filter), 
                the IMU readout (with DMP), and the motor control. Below is a video of one of the trial runs:

            </div>
            <p>
                There are a few notable things about this trial. Firstly, the car does reach the wall and start turning at around 3 tiles (3 ft), and 
                then turns around and drives back as desired. Below is an image of the error inputs to the PID for this run, split into the 3 stages.

                In state 0 and 2, this shows the error in TOF distance from the desired target (904 mm) in mm, and in state 1, it is the difference in 
                angle in degrees for orientation control. Some notes are that one can observe in state 0 the error decreases to 0, which once that is 
                reached, a turn starts. In state 1, the oscillation back and forth of the car can be seen, before it meets the error threshold, about 180 
                degrees away from the initial yaw. Then, in state 2, the car drives away, having noisy measurements due to no objects being close in sensor 
                view. Below are the TOF, Yaw, and motor commands:

            <p>
                The TOF uses the Kalman filter to predict the distance when new TOF readings are not ready, and can trigger the next state. The TOF can be observed 
                to vary a lot as the car spins as well. The yaw shows the car spinning and reaching 180 degrees from the initial yaw. The motor command also demonstrates the 3 states, with 
                the motors starting with PID control in the same direction, then spinning opposite directions to turn, and then turning the same directions to drive away. 
                Below is a second trial with the same PID values, and the sensor readings associated:

                In these last 2 trial runs, while the drift does work and the car comes back, I noticed 2 major shortcomings. First, the car would overshoot a 
                lot during the orientation phase, wasting time. Secondly, even with PID, the car would always slide very close to the wall, preventing a faster approach without 
                collision. To attempt to address these, I changed the initial setpoint to 5 feet and raised the initial proportional term to a P of 0.15, with the hope that the 
                extra room would allow the car to approach faster and not hit the wall. Secondly, I lowered the P value for the orientation control from 0.9 to 0.7 to lower the 
                initial speed of the rotation, and raised the derivative to 0.03 to help prevent overshoot. This is the trial I got from this:

                There are several important notes from this run. Firstly, the trial is overall much faster, taking only 5 seconds of video versus the other runs 8 or 9 seconds.
                This is also reflected in the time stamps of each individual segment, with the yaw oscillation especially being smaller. The oscillations also appear to be smaller. However,
                it also does slightly bump into the wall, showing that even with the 5 foot distance to start the drift, the car still slides too far. This is reflective of 
                the primary challenge of this lab, which is the tradeoff of speed and overshoot. Whenever I tried to do something faster, the amount of sliding and overshoot 
                was far larger. This can be partially mitigated in PID terms, but is still prevalant. Additionally, this stunt is incredibly surface dependent, due to variable amounts 
                of friction. Even different tiles behaved differently, seen below: 
            </p>
            <div class="centered">
                <video width="640" height="480" controls>
                    <source src="/images/lab8/trial4.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
                </video> 
            </div>
            <p>
                The car doesnt repeatedly overshoot during orientation control on this type of tile, overshooting just once and then being able to navigate to the correct angle. 
                This shows that different PID values will make this stunt behave differently on different surfaces. One improvement that might make the car more consistent
                would be to add more friction to the car wheels, as they seem to be slipping too much with the duct tape. While a certain amount of slipping is needed for 
                the stunt, the more it slips, the less control the car has over the stunt, such as sliding into a wall or continually overshooting on orientation.
            </p>
            <h4><Strong>Blooper</Strong></h4>
            <p>
                Below is a blooper of one of the worst collisions the car had:
            </p>
            <div class="centered">

            </div>
            <p>
                The car properly does the drift (albeit at low speed), but I failed to consider that the wall behind it was glass. Normally, the 
                PID control would stop a collision, but the TOF struggles with the glass, so the car runs into it at top speed.
            </p>
